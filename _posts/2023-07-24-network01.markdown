# Network Part 1_01

Before Diving into the network, I recommend you to read the Data communication sections first!!
(It deals with the basic concept of Internet protocols, data link layer and Physical Layer)

Then, Let's get started!

## First, What Is the OSI Model?

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network

-   Application Layer (top of the layer)
-   Presentation Layer, Session Layer
-   Transport Layer
-   ✨Network Layer✨ -> part1 cover this!
-   Data Link Layer
-   Physical Layer (Layer 1, bottom of the layer)

the standard model of network
= router + switch -> LAN (A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home.)

## Router

Use of a router

• connecting different LAN(sub network)s
• determining the effective datagram transmission path through other routers on the outside network (routing algorithm)
• Forwarding datagrams based on IP address _'range'_ information
• Router has at least two ports
Assign 2 IP addresses when using 2 ports: 1 external address and 1 internal address

e.g.
![p1](/assets/01/p1)
10.5.0.2(external) 192.168.0.1(internal)
• A host exists on the LAN with an IP address of up to 192.168.0.3 – 8

#### Subnet mask

Masking is used to get some bits of the given data

> _Mask and remove 4 bits from the back_
> Masking “11111111” with “11110000” -> “11110000” (AND)
> Masking “10101010” with “11110000” -> “10100000”

Subnet(=LAN) mask
• Used to determine if a given IP address belongs to the same subnet or not

e.g. suppose you have 255.255.255.0 as a subnet mask
This subnet mask shows that the first 24 bits are all 1 and The rest of the bits are all 0
With this mask value, turn on the value of the first 24 bits of the IP address and turn off the next 8 bits (AND bit operation)
203.89.56.12 & mask -> 203.89.56.0
203.89.56.32 & mask -> 203.89.56.0
203.89.57.32 & mask -> 203.89.57.0

<font color="red">If IP addresses A and B have the same value after masking , it is determined that they are on the same subnet</font>
